<p>	I have a unique understanding of the word ‘Experience’. To me, this word encompasses anything that can broaden your view on the universe we live in or the people around us. The field where you can find Experience in the greatest abundance is art.</p>

<p>This page is a dedicated log of all the art and literature I’ve consumed throughout the years. It currently features movies, tv shows, and books. I have plans to eventually include video games I’ve played and cities I’ve visited.</p>
