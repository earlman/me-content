    id: fundamentals

---

Human existence is a set of *now-moments*. A now-moment, like the concept of Tao cannot be defined, only described.

Each now-moment is infinite in possibility and inexectricably linked to a subject's perception. Every now-moment is real and unique.

A now-moment fundamentally consists of 3 aspects which are distinct, inseparable, and non-interchangeable.

| Concept | Verb Form | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| Maintenance | to maintain | concepts, processes, and activities concerning *what one has* |
| Action | to act | concepts, processes, and activities concerning *what one wants* |
| Experience | to experience | concepts, processes, and activities concerning *what exists* |
