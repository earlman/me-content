# Hello friends!

Thank you all for lending your ears. I know I’m quite vocal on social media. It’s always a struggle to find a balance between the words that I say and the words I leave in my head. 

I’ve often found it best to err on the side of caution, but the world is changing quite quickly and I’ve got lots of words that I think could help others find dry land amongst these turbulent seas. 

I’ll make sure your attention doesn’t go to waste. I’m honored to have it 🙏🏼

## So whatcha into?

I’m comfortable writing about anything, but I’m doing this to make an impact. Let me know what you wanna spend time on.

### Spending on yourself

I think your money is *always* best spent on whatever provides you the most growth as an individual. So&mdash;after you save up for that iPad + Apple Pencil you’ve been wanting&mdash;consider throwing me a couple dollars for being the one to finally convince you to follow your dreams (hehe a bit dramatic, eh? 😅)

But in all seriousness, if you have the means, consider supporting more independent creators&mdash;especially those you’ve been following for a while. These are these people we can count on most to show us *their* truth, regardless of how much they’re paid or what’s happening in the outside world.

And I assure you: as an artist myself, there is nothing more uplifiting than having my truth valued.

## A note

I’m not starting this newsletter to market my brand. It’s not me trying to find an easy way to make money. This platform was built so I can broadcast my own truth for anyone interested in listening.

So why do I think my truth’s so important? Because I work harder than anyone I know trying to turn this planet into something the universe would be proud of. One where *you*, specifically, would gladly spend the rest of your life.

It’s not just a dream. It’s a puzzle. The pieces are right here in front of us.
