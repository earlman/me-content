Dear friend and subscriber,

Thank you. 

I love to speak. I love my words. But on the internet, I only seem to be able to find them when I feel the need to say something that most wouldn't agree with. In the past, I've written out these long articles and Facebook posts not because it would bring me joy, but because I felt like I had no choice. Because it felt like we were devolving into nihilism and pessimism and if I didn't do something about it, I would regret it. And sometimes somebody replies to that post and I know they're hurt a little about something I said. It hurts. Maybe it hurts even more than it hurts them, because I have no idea if that post was the right thing to do or not. 

This is not that. 

I'm not starting this newsletter because I think there are broken things that need to be fixed (which I do). I'm starting it because I have exciting things to share. The fact that there are people who would like to hear what I have to say&mdash;It's a feeling like no other. When I say things that people find rude and offensive; when I expose a bit of my soul and there's no response, it's easy to assume that all of that buzzing in my head are the dialectics of a crazy person. But there's 12 people I've sent this email to and the fact that y'all are here even though my words have hurt plenty of y'all in the past... man.

okay enough of that

I've spend a lot of time on the newsletter, but I've pulled waaaay back on my aspirations for this first one. Eventually I want you to be able to click a *like button* on posts, I want to have surveys and special editions and more links and videos, so that I can see what you're into and how I can best serve you. I also need to fix some of the formatting. It only looks half as good as I designed it because email's a bitch about CSS. 

But for now, I just have a question. Obviously, you don't need to reply. Obviously, you can say as much or as little as you want about what you thought about my articles or what sort of things I should try out. But don't worry too much about all that. For now, what were your two favorite items on this issue? 

Love y'all,

Earl
