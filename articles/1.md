As somebody who’s quite picky about the content they consume, I’ve been having a hard time with the mainstream media platforms in recent years. Just like most, I’m a steady user of Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit and the services have definitely been going downhill.

There’s a lot specific problems with each service, but I think the issues mostly stem from their business model. They make money selling their users’ attention. It’s free and they need some way to make income, so it’s definitely understandable. But, when it comes down to it, their business goals are to:

1. Seize their users’ attention as efficiently as possible.
2. Sell as much of that attention as they can get away with.

So what does that look like from a user’s viewpoint? Well we’ve all experienced it firsthand. It looks like endless scrolling, click-bait content, and, well, as many ads as they can get away with.

In the past I’ve always used these platforms to learn more about the things I care about—so it’s not quite ideal that Google and Facebook uses the information hack my own behavior. I’ve spent a lot of time trying to find a place where I can keep track of my favorite creators and I finally found something worth recommending.

After almost a year, Inoreader is one of the first apps I open in the morning. It’s where I save all of my content, follow all of the people I like, and keep track of the outside world. It’s all too much to talk about in one post, but what really sells it for me is the ability to control exactly what I see.

The app revolves around an old technology that just refuses to die—RSS. This broadcast system—which reached its peak a decade ago—seems to have been rediscovered as a powerful weapon in the battle for our content. 

Not only has Inoreader chosen to make RSS a first-class citizen of the platform, they’re really an RSS reader *in spirit* as well. Their feature set includes all of the customization you could possibly imagine: tags, viewing options, filters, folders, etc. And you know what feature it *doesn’t* include?? SUGGESTED ARTICLES OMFG (*ahem* Pocket)

But really, go to their [website](https://www.inoreader.com) and read what they have to offer because that list definitely didn’t do them justice. 

Another functionality that I really wanna highlight is that Inoreader doesn’t stop with blogs, which is the main use case for RSS. It lets you aggregate content from everywhere—Youtube, Twitter, Reddit, Pinterest—They even let you subscribe to “active searches,” where the scour the web and drown you with all the “Design System” content you could possibly imagine.

Inoreader is way too powerful for me to sufficiently cover here, so I’d definitely suggest going over to their [blog](https://blog.inoreader.com/category/for-power-users). You can tell that they’re definitely doing their best to make sure it’s a useful resource for getting the most out of what the app has to offer.
