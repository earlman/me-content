They say a picture's worth a thousand words, but I don't quite find that to be the case. That statement seems to imply that a picture&mdash;and by extension, our visual world&mdash;holds more value than the things we say.

The way I see it, our words have accelerated the development of human civilization more than pictures ever could. Pictures are amazing in their own right&mdash;the frozen light of a **now**, captured and encoded in 1s and 0s, for appreciation at later moment. But, words are different. They transcend time. They transcend space.

## Part 1: Transcending Space-Time

There's a reason we can understand *the rise and fall of the roman empire, the gruesome insanity of medieval torture,* or *the courage and bravery of the first Polynesian explorers as they sailed across the pacific.* It's because the noises we make, though nonsensical to every other living organism, somehow have the capacity to convey meaning. Words convey meaning, and it's meaning that's applicable to the entire universe. Our words have allowed us to build concepts that stay consistent no matter *where* we are or *when* we say they them.

I find that interesting enough already, but there's more depth to be found here.  Maybe you've heard this before&mdash;our capacity for **abstraction** is what separates us as human beings. It's the reason we've gone so far beyond the limits of the animal kingdom. We have the unique ability to notice patterns, then apply them to the physical world. When we notice a pattern, we can *imagine* how that may be applied to another situation. Words are an extension of that ability.

When I notice a pattern, it's instantaneous. There's no words yet for it. For example:

**2  4  6  8  10  <u>?</u>**

For the more educated among you, 12 comes to mind instantly. "Twelve" is obviously a word, but that's preceded by your recognition of the sequence of numbers. You didn't think: "Those are even numbers, hence, twelve." You thought "twelve"&mdash;and your thought of "those are even numbers" comes much later. Maybe it doesn't come at all. 

So this capability of abstraction is instantaneous, but that also makes it limited. It only exists in *your* brain. A facet of your individual consciousness. Until you put it into words, that is.



## Part 2: Memes

An old pet peeve of mine was when somebody used a word incorrectly. I'd annoyingly point out the their mistake, and they'd say "but you get what I mean"

Even more annoyingly, I'd retort "but then what's even the point of words??"

My line of thought was: *If the meaning of words change depending on who's using them, what's the point of words anyway?* 

Well, the point was made right there, and I rejected it, choosing to focus instead on something much less useful. The point was to find common understanding with a friend. I rejected it out of dogma, an attachment to what I thought the word *should mean*. What really mattered was that *I understood what my friend was saying.*

Pictures, as powerful as they are, can only represent a single point of data in 1 person's life, out of the 7.5 billion people on this planet. It's a moment in time. An anecdote, essentially. A word, on the other hand, is created through the mutual understanding of all those who use it. The word "apple" brings up different images and experiences for each and every one of us, and all of those images are elements of what an apple really is.

Now it gets exciting. Every time a word is spoken or memed, its meaning changes slightly. The meaning gets infused with the message of the speaker. When people hear you speak, they will associate the *words you use* with *what you're trying to say*.

This means every time you speak, you participate in the collective development of the human race.



## Part 3: Imagining Things Together

> What really mattered was that *I understood what my friend was saying.*

That's how I think we move forward as a species. Collective understanding. This is why we have words in the first place. Words exist so that humans can create abstractions with our *collective imagination*, rather than our ego. With words, we can build things in a way that works well for everybody. 

Words are the vehicle for abstract thought. Like the nerves in our body or the roads in our cities, they connect small parts into a *whole*. *They* helped us become a *civilization*, rather than just a group of primates. From an *me* and a *you*, words have created an *us*.

It's easy to get hung up when words are used incorrectly. Frankly, I'll still correct you if you're using a word wrong. But it's sometimes too easy to get hung up on the "they're" and "theirs"&mdash;but I'm starting to think that that goes against the spirit of conversation. If the point of words are to find collective understanding, shouldn't we spend more time acknowledging the points we have in common, rather than harping on the minor details that set us apart?
