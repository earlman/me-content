​	I see all of life as Maintenance, Action, and Experience. I've spoken to a few of you about this but I won't get into it now. Experience, for me, is the end-all-be-all of this whole thing&mdash;all of consciousness, of life, of science and spirituality. This whole game is just us figuring out and defining what it means to be a part of this human experience.

​	But building and participating in experience needs to start from somewhere. Let's call it *reality*&mdash;the reality of needing a job, of needing a stable income, a place to live, insurance for when things go wrong, etc. *Reality* is different for each one of us, and yet is the starting point for all our individual creativity. Without our own definition of reality, we wouldn't know how to act. We wouldn't even know where to begin.

​	Regrettably, our needs for a specific type of reality are used against us. Fear can show up in our reality as a need for security, so we're told the world is full of death and despair, and *they* know what's safe for us. We need food sustenance, so they give us cheaply satisfying junk to fill our bodies. We need to feel like we belong, so they show us our friends, then manipulate our streams of information. One more. They way that we could be great if only we worked hard enough, then they send us to schools and tell us what work *is* and *isn't* meaningful.

​	If I'm ever to fully immerse myself in experience, I need to have the final say in my reality. It's not about power&mdash;there's plenty of things I can't control. But my ability to eat cannot depend on my ability to follow orders. The future of my sisters, my parents, and my friends must not depend on the rise and fall of the markets&mdash;on the ignorant and egotistical in charge of our corporations. In order to wholly follow my dreams, I need to take care of the well-being of all those I love.

​	These are the foundations I am building. The foundations of a reality where every person I love needs not fear a lack of a home. Where our security is not dependent on our loyalty to me or any man in charge. A universe in which each one of us decides our contribution and how much is enough. A place that's firm and strong and resilient to the decaying societal structures that surround us.

​	This is work, but not even my life's work. Like I said, I'm here for the experience. Foundations is just maintenance&mdash;just the basics. Sustenance and security for all those who surround me. It's a long ways away, and maybe I won't even get there in my lifetime. But I've no doubt that it's the right direction.
