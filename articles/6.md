I [posted](https://www.facebook.com/earljman/posts/2416541865025623) this on facebook at the beginning of last summer and it got a lot of buzz. Seems like a topic people wanted understand better. Even got a message from someone asking for some relationship advice about dating people with ADHD.

It can be frustrating for people with ADHD that everybody claims that "they kinda have it too." So I just wanna clear some stuff up.

ADHD is NOT:
- Going 48 hours on coffee and Wendy's with 2 hours of sleep and not being able to stay focused
- Not getting anything done bc you're trying to study with your phone vibrating 2 feet in front of you
- Being distracted by a constant urge to check your phone or get on Netflix bc you're addicted

ADHD is:
- when all your thoughts and short term memories are balanced on a tightrope and the slightest breeze brings everything to the ground.
- when you're totally healthy and well rested but can't complete a sentence properly because you had a different thought in the middle of it.
