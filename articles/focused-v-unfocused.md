## Part 1

My greatest insight of this week is the clear difference between focused and unfocused work and how to use the knowledge of which is which to your advantage. So I guess my one of my greatest issues before was my inability to tell the difference. Because of this, emotional stressors and physical weariness made enormous impacts on my productivity. This entire week I have been able to clear loads and loads of errands off my to-do list, without much effort or wear.

Since I begun creating habits, Iâ€™ve found that the mind and body arenâ€™t as connected as I once thought. When oneâ€™s tired, the other may still have gas left in the tank. In the past, when I was tired or I lost motivation, there was nothing I could do to get myself out of the apartment. It could be because of emotional issues, or my energy being gone from a party last night. Whatever it is, I was convinced that my mind and my body were uselessâ€¦ so.. better to just sleep it off.

This was totally wrong. Thereâ€™s so much that you can get accomplished when you feel unfocused. You just gotta fucking do it. Even if youâ€™re not in the best of moods, there are loads and loads of tasks that you can get done anyway. I know.. itâ€™s probably common sense to most, but I think this realization will result in enormous benefits in the future.

I think that this idea from my mom and my girlfriend. When theyâ€™re upset, menial tasks seem even easier for them. Theyâ€™ll c wash her dishes, finish laundry, vacuum the floor, and shower, all in a sullen silence. Meanwhile, an emotional distraction could leave me stranded in a bed for hours.

On a separate note, a further realization is that focused work isnâ€™t always as focused as youâ€™d imagine.

My chemistry research, for instance. It would make sense to categorize this as focused work, correct? But thatâ€™s not always true. Thereâ€™s, in fact, only 30 minutes where I need to really bite down and not let my attention wander, and those times are where Iâ€™m making decisions. Everything else is procedural, actions that are based on the decisions I have already made.

So Iâ€™ve recently been able to bring myself to complete certain tasks and errands that I would have easily put off before by reminding myself that my mind doesnâ€™t have to move a muscle. I just need to get up and do it.

## Part 2



So Iâ€™ve recently been surfing The Art of Manliness a good amount, and Iâ€™ve found myself listening to a podcast of an interview with the bestselling author Cal Newport. It was interesting-I learned today that my thoughts from last week have recently been researched in-depth and written about in Newportâ€™s Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success.

The main ideas that I have on this topic are mostly the same as those in the book (not that I necessarily was looking for confirmation for my thoughts). The main difference, it seems, between his thinking and mine is that Newport focuses on how to develop and maintain your capacity for deep work, while my thoughts are generally based on making the unfocused work more efficient, and finding time to do them when youâ€™re not doing anything else. This, in my opinion, is much more important in the lives of college students, since we have many different commitments that take up our time, which change every day, and can happen at any time.

The most important thing at this point of my life is building a trusted system that takes care of all of the shallow work, which is all the things that you have to do that donâ€™t take much thinking power. I think OneNote one of best methods for outlining your life â€“ especially when much of it depends on your computer and the internet. Iâ€™ll probably expand more on the apps I use later.

Another difference between Newport and I is that my definition for deep work is expanded to making decisions, because there are a lot of those â€“ what events to attend, what clubs to join, who to hang out with, what homework to start on, etc. My thinking is that if the shallow work, that takes no work and almost no energy, is added to my to do list, then decisions should be too. So this is what I do. For example, when I get an email that requires a decision that I notice is taking a lot more brain power than I expected to use, then I put it off for later. This keeps me moving through my inbox, and allows me to get all the emails sorted and prioritized. I usually save these decisions for my commute or a time when Iâ€™m not working on any other tasks on my computer so that I can look up necessary information as needed.

Writing about productivity is a lot of fun ðŸ™‚ Iâ€™ve enjoyed the last two focused vs. unfocused articles and I definitely plan on doing more. Its helpful to keep a lot of everything that Iâ€™m trying (productivity-wise), especially since Iâ€™m always trying new things. There have been a lot of things that I put into my system this semester, so Iâ€™ll probably write about those soon. Iâ€™m pretty open to change so nothing is set.
