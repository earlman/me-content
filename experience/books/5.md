I spent 4 months last semester studying in Amsterdam and travelling around Europe and this book still is one of the most beautiful things I've come in contact with all year.

## Review

I’m trying to write a review of this book, but the ideas explored on humanity and intelligence are so difficult to express.

For now I’ll say that, just as the novel implies, this piece of art seems to provide more wisdom on humanity than a scientific study ever could.
