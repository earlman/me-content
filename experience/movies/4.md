Man, Star Wars fans are really gonna hate me for that review lol. What I really wish to say is that this movie was the catalyst for digging into the entire Star Wars universe as a whole. The final scene where Princess Leia escapes from Vader cemented the idea that the beauty of Star Wars is in its epicness&mdash;in every sense of the word. Hopefully some day I'll be able to give the original trilogy the attentative watch it deserves.

## Review

The Star Wars movie also was very good. My favorite, I think, of all time. I actually think that, for me, made the whole entire Star Wars saga much better. It just fit in perfectly, giving me a whole new understanding to the depth of the plot-how the rebellion fit in with the empire and alliance, how truly desparate the struggle was once Darth Vadar betrayed the council, and how little hope was left until they were able to steal the Death Star plans.
