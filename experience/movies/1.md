## Review

This was probably one of the best movies I’ve seen in the past year. The plot was nothing special, it was about a jazz musician and amateur actress trying to make their way into success, while attempting to balance it with their love. The popular motif of family vs. career. However, I don’t think I’ve seen a movie that has done it as well as this one. The cinematography, actors, set design, music score (it’s a musical), were all phenomenal.

The last montage at the end was especially amazing, and left the audience with an amazingly happy feel although they did not end up living together happily ever after. This was akin to what Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) must have felt after playing Mia a final song. There’s a lot I could say about the movie, but I find it unnecessary, as it doesn’t seem like something I will forget.
