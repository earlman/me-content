## Notes

    * DC’s got a lot of catching up to do… But wonder woman’s a good start
    * Holy hell Gal Gadot is beautiful
    * Chris Pine is also beautiful… and I was quite impressed with his acting in this movie
    * I really hope it beats Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. It’s at $600 rn-only $250 mil to go!
    * wtf the first action scene with the Amazons against the Germans… I’d probably say the best action scene that DC has ever produced
    * There were too many unnecessary things… Mostly back stories we didn’t need for characters that were rather insignificant in the scope of the movie. Can we stop normalizing 2.5 hour superhero movies…?
