# My [Blog's](https://earlman.me) Content

This repository contains only the content (articles, notes, tweets, creations, etc) of my blog at [earlman.me](https://earlman.me). It has two responsibilities:

1) Track the content and changes to the content
2) Don't do anything besides what's mentioned in item 1

[The rest of the website's code can be found here](https://github.com/earlman/me)

# Formatting

This content will be stored as Markdown files, with properties formatted as YAML.

There will eventually be requirements for the properties of each piece of content.
